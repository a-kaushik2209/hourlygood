# Saarthi: Unified Emergency Response Prototype

## Overview
Saarthi is a unified, inclusive, and priority-based emergency response and coordination system. This prototype demonstrates the core flows for ideathon presentation:
- Emergency reporting (user flow)
- Priority-based visualization (map clustering)
- Volunteer/Donor sign-up
- NGO/Admin dashboard (mock data)

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (create-react-app), HTML/CSS
- **Map**: OpenStreetMap (static embed/mock)
- **Backend**: None (mock data only)

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. In the project directory, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## Screens
- Landing Page: Intro, login/signup
- Emergency Reporting: SOS form, location input
- Priority Map: Clustered reports, color-coded
- Volunteer/Donor Signup: Quick join form
- NGO/Admin Dashboard: Visualized reports, resource/task map (mock)

## Note
This is a prototype for ideathon/demo purposes. No real backend or SMS/IVR integration is present. All data is mocked.
